# XPBonus

This feature adds bonus xp when receiving xp.

## How to use it?

In all your season configs, you can find this section:

```yaml
xpBonus:
  enabled: true
  value: 10
```

### What is 'value'?

The value is in percent and specifies the bonus xp that you will get when
you receive xp from something.

#### Example

Let's say you got `100 xp` and the value is set to `10`.

That means that you will get a total of `110 xp`.
